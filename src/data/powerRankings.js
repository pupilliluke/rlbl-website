      team: "Drunken Goats",
      body: `One of only 2 teams from season 1 that decided to stay the course for Season 2. The Drunken Goats look primed to take the next step. Matt led the team offensively with 62 goals, enough to place 4th overall in the league. Dundee stepped up on the physical side with a league-leading 37 demos. The combination of these stats produces a fast-paced, high-scoring offense and iron-clad defense. Based on last season's chemistry, will The Drunken Goats make a run for the Beer Mug?`

      team: "MJ",
      body: `Fresh off of a Beer Mug Championship run, John G. looks to run it back after losing star teammate Tyler. Donâ€™t be mistaken; John had a legendary performance in the Beer Mug Final to clinch the series and is a star in the making. Conversely, Masonâ€™s season ended in heartbreak after failing to qualify for the playoffs. Even after posting a record-breaking 52 saves on the year. Will John bask in Championship glory again? Or is Mason going to get all too familiar with heartbreak?`

      team: "Nonchalant",
      body: `The Revenge Tour is here. After a devastating loss in the finals last season, Jack looks to redeem himself with rookie teammate A Rob by his side. Jack was able to post 74 goals (2nd), 31 Assists (2nd), and 33 saves (5th) last season. A Rob will be making his RLBL debut this season. Early reports on the rookie show a high compete level and an upside of 20+ goals this season. Will Jackâ€™s dominance continue into season 2? Will A Rob have a rookie performance for the ages?`

      team: "Overdosed Otters",
      body: `A team on the losing side of a playoff battle for the ages. The Overdosed Otters come into this season with a newfound determination. Ben had a fast start to last season, while his goal scoring tapered in the later half, his defensive play stayed consistent and got stronger leading into the post season ending the year with 31 saves. Dylan produced a lackluster regular season but played his best in the playoffs, scoring 8 goals and making 12 saves in 5 games. Will Dylanâ€™s playoff play carry into season 2? Will Benâ€™s goal scoring stay hot throughout the year?`

    {
      team: "Bronny James",
      body: `Looking to be a staunch defensive threat with an underrated offensive punch, Bronny James is primed to be a dark horse this season for a deep playoff run. Stan had a slow start last season but quickly picked up his play ending the season with 37 goals and 24 assists. Robert and former teammate Jax could not find an offensive groove during the regular season. This did not prevent Robert from placing 2nd in DPOY voting and placing 4th in saves last season. The question remains: Can their offense find a spark?`

    {
      team: "Chicken Jockeys",
      body: `Fresh off of an excellent regular season and playoff campaign that ended with a loss in the finals, Vince is potentially the most underrated player in RLBL. Leading the league in assists with 32 and scored 46 goals last season. A part of an offense that never clicked last season, Jax looks to find his groove as an elite passer. Can Jax become an elite passer and help Vince get redemption?`

    {
      team: "Nick Al Nite",
      body: `Nothing is more dangerous than someone with something to prove. Nick Al Nite is exactly that, featuring two returning players in Big Nick and Alex K. Big Nick had a top-tier scoring campaign last year, scoring 64 goals (3rd), 23 assists, and 39 saves (3rd). Despite this, he still fell short in the playoffs, and now he seeks a championship win. Alex ate a lot of dirt last season, now he comes into this season with fire to give it right back. Having fine-tuned his net-front goal-scoring play style in the offseason, he is ready to go and is better than ever. Can Nick and Alex prove it?`
    },
    {
      team: "Mid Boost",
      body: `After leading Corner Boost to a hot start last season, things sizzled fast as they finished with a 12-12 record and were bounced from the playoffs in round one. Austin still finished with excellent stats, however. Posting 51 goals and 30 saves, but can Austin stay hot?`
    },
    {
      team: "Double Bogey",
      body: `Quinn found out the hard way that defense does not win championships. Even though Quinn won DPOY and made 43 saves (2nd), it did not translate into wins. With a rookie teammate in Nick B., can Quinn's defensive prowess finally translate to wins?`
